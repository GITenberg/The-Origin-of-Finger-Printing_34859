<p><i>I am offering you this old story of the beginnings of
Finger-printing, by way of expressing my warm and

its original applications, whereby, first in Bengal and the

<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The following pages have two objects: first, to
place on record the genesis of the Finger-print
method of personal identification, from its discovery
in Bengal in 1858, till its public demonstration
there in 1877-8; secondly, to examine the scanty
suggestions of evidence that this use of our fingers
had been foreshadowed in Europe more than a
hundred years ago, and had indeed been general in
ancient times, especially in China.</p>

<p>In later years, and in energetic hands, the method
has been developed into a system far more effective
than anything I contemplated, and I do not go into
that part of the story; but I believe these pages will
suffice to show the originality of my study of its two
essential features, the strict individuality and the
stubborn persistence of the patterns on our fingers.</p>

<p>The gift granted to me of lighting upon a discovery
which promised escape from one great difficulty
of administration in India is more than ever appreciated
by me since I have lived to see the promise
wonderfully fulfilled there, and in other lands as well.</p>

<p>For the sake of interest I give, among the illustrations,
several examples of late 'repeats' taken
many years after I left India; but these do not
belong to my story.</p>

<h2>THE ORIGIN OF FINGER-PRINTING</h2>


<p>In 1858, after five years' service, as an Assistant
under the old East India Company, in the interior
of Bengal, I was in charge of my first subdivision,
the head-quarters of which were then at Jungipoor,
on the upper reaches of the Hooghly river. My
executive and magisterial experience had by that
time forced on me that distrust of all evidence
tendered in Court which did so much to cloud our
faith in the people around us. We cannot be too
thankful that things have greatly improved in India
in the last sixty years, but the time of which I am
speaking was the very worst time of my life in this
respect. I remember only too well writing in great
despondency to one of the best and soberest-minded
of my senior companions at Haileybury<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> about my
despair of any good coming from orders and decisions
based on such slippery facts, and the comfort I
found in his sensible reply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">

<span class="caption">Contract for 2,000 maunds of road-metalling, between W. J. Herschel
and Rajyadhar Konai, in Konai&#39;s handwriting</span>
</div>

<p>It happened, in July of that year, that I was
starting the first bit of road metalling at Jungipoor,
and invited tenders for a supply of 'ghooting'
(a good binding material for light roads).
A native named R&#257;jyadhar K&#333;n&#257;i, of the village
of Nist&#257;, came to terms with me, and at my
desire drew up our agreement in his own hand,
in true commercial style. He was about to
sign it in the usual way, at the upper right-hand
corner, when I stopped him in order to read it
myself; and it then occurred to me to try an
experiment by taking the stamp of his hand, by
way of signature instead of writing. There was
nothing very original about that, as an idea. Many
must have heard of some such use of a man's hand;
and the correspondence that has taken place has
brought to light old instances of the hand, or the
nail of a finger, or the teeth in one's mouth, being
used to certify a man's act, or a woman's. But
these have all been isolated instances. Sir Francis
Galton, however, has pointed out<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> that in our own
times the engraver Bewick had a fancy for engraving
his thumb-mark, with his name attached, as
vignettes, or as colophons, in books which he published.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
As a boy I had loved Bewick on Birds:
I regret that it is not now to be found in our library.
Galton's remark has reminded me that I used to
see the thumb-mark there, as well as I recollect, in
an ornamental title-page. I mention this because
I dare say it had something to do with my fascination
over K&#333;n&#257;i's hand-markings. If so, the influence
was unknown to me. The absorbing interests of
manhood had blotted out, not Bewick, but his
thumb-mark, from my memory. However that
may be, I was only wishing to frighten K&#333;n&#257;i out
of all thought of repudiating his signature hereafter.
He, of course, had never dreamt of such an attestation,
but fell in readily enough. I dabbed his palm
and fingers over with the home-made oil-ink used
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
for my official seal, and pressed the whole hand on
the back of the contract, and we studied it together,
with a good deal of chaff about palmistry, comparing
his palm with mine on another impression. Here
is a facsimile of the whole document, made by
the Clarendon Press. I was so pleased with
the experiment that, having to make a second
contract with K&#333;n&#257;i, I made him attest it in the
same way. One of these contracts I gave to
Sir Francis (then Mr.) Galton for his celebrated
paper read before the Royal Society, November
1890, to which body he presented it; the other lies
before me now. Trials with my own fingers soon
showed the advantage of using them instead of
the whole hand for the purpose then in view,
i.e. for securing a signature which the writer would
obviously hesitate to disown. That he might be
infallibly convicted of perjury, if he did, is a very
different matter. That was not settled, and could
not have been settled, to the satisfaction of Courts
of Justice, till, after many years, abundant agreement
had been reached among ordinary people.
The very possibility of such a 'sanction' (to use
a technical expression) to the use of a finger-print
did not dawn upon me till after long experience, and
even then it became no more than a personal conviction
for many years more. The decisiveness of a
finger-print is now one of the most powerful aids to
Justice. Our possession of it derives from the
impression of K&#333;n&#257;i's hand in 1858.</p>

<p>Of trials with my own fingers the oldest impression
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
I possess was taken in June 1859, when I first
began to keep records. I had been transferred to
be Magistrate of Arrah, the most north-westerly
district of Bengal, where the Mutiny still left work
to do which allowed little time for private hobbies;
but I took so many prints among the society of the
Station, as well as among Indians of all classes, that
my 'fad' about them was well known. The Medical
Officer of Arrah was Dr. R. F. Hutchinson, who
naturally took great interest in the subject. Twenty-one
years later, in 1880, he was still there, and sent
me a 'repeat' print of his fingers. Here is a facsimile
of his first Arrah impression. In 1890,
being in England, he visited Galton's Laboratory,
and gave a second repeat (after thirty-one years)
which was used in 'Finger-prints' (1892), p. 93, to
support Mr. Galton's evidence of 'Persistency'. In
the facsimile 'Collection 1858-1913', which I am
attaching to some of the copies of this narrative,
will be found other prints which I took at Arrah of
my whole hand and of my right foot. They agree
irresistibly with prints taken now after an interval
of fifty-seven years.</p>

<p>In 1860 I was sent as Magistrate to Nuddea,
nearer to Calcutta. The Indigo disturbances in the
district had given rise to a great deal of violence,
litigation, and fraud; forgery and perjury were
rampant. The rent-rolls of the ryots put into Court
by the Zemindars; the pottahs (agreements for rent)
purporting to be issued by them to each ryot, put
in by the latter; the kabooliyats (acceptances) purporting
to be signed by the ryot, and tendered in
evidence against him; all these documents were
frequently worth no more than the paper on which
they were written. In my own jail a notorious
convict was found making clay seals of well-known
landlords, and forging their signatures on pottahs
smuggled into his hands. He was detected by the
colour of the floor of his cell, where he kept his
stock-in-trade buried. Things were so bad in this
and other ways that the administration of Civil
Justice had unusual difficulty in preserving its
dignity. I was driven to take up finger-prints
now with a definite object before me, and for
three years continued taking a very large number
from all sorts and conditions of men. I give here
some selected impressions of friends taken in
Nuddea during the years 1860, 1861, and 1862, in
order of date, and names of some others.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<p>1860, July. Claude Brown, a prominent merchant
of Calcutta, who was making a tour in the
Indigo districts, and was at the time my guest.</p>

<p>1860, July 29. Captain H. Raban, Head of the
Bengal Police, sent to Nuddea on account of its
disturbed state; also my guest. He took extreme
interest in the evidence of his own imprint. It
was my habit, of course, to give duplicates of his
'mark' to every one of importance.</p>

<span class="caption">Captain H. Raban, Head of the Police in Lower Bengal, July 29, 1860.</span>
</div>

<p>1860, July 31. W. Waterfield, B.C.S., a college
friend, afterwards Comptroller-General of the
Treasuries of India.  I have several 'repeats' of
his; see especially p. 29.</p>

<p>1861, June 24. Ogilvie Temple, Judge of the
Court of Small Causes, Kooshtea.</p>

<p>1862, April 13. At a gathering at my house at
Kishnagar I had the good fortune to secure the
prints of many other notables of the district.</p>

<p>The Mah&#257;r&#257;j&#257; of Nuddea. He was the highest
of the old nobility of Bengal. He was much struck,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
as I was, by the remarkable symmetry of the
'pattern' on one of his fingers at the core.</p>

<span class="caption">April 13, 1862.<br />

</span>
</div>

<p>Same day. E. Grey, B.C.S. A college friend,
on my staff, afterwards Civil and Sessions Judge.
He, I am happy to say, is still alive (1916), and his
'repeat' is quite good now.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/i015b.jpg" width="640" height="347" alt="A. C. Howard." title="" />
<span class="caption">Sir Charles Howard.</span>
</div>

<p>Same day. A. C. Howard, District Superintendent
of Police, Nuddea, afterwards Assistant Commissioner
at Scotland Yard, and knighted for his
services there, as Sir Charles Howard. He gladly
gave me a 'repeat' in London after forty-six years.
It will be seen how good the persistence has been.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Same day. Three other Assistant Magistrates on
the unusually large staff of the district. Among
these was F. K. Hewitt, B.C.S., afterwards Commissioner
of Chota Nagpur. Twenty-six years later,
at my request, he furnished Sir Francis Galton
with the 'repeat' printed on p. 93 of his famous
work 'Finger-prints' (Macmillan, 1892). I have
much later repeats taken at Oxford.</p>

<p>Same day. Ninian H. Thomson, Judge of the
Court of Small Causes. He kindly sent me a repeat
twenty-eight years later from Florence, and this
also appears in the same work, p. 93.</p>

<p>Very early in my experiments I entertained misgivings
about the possibility of the impressions
being forged by the professional criminals whom
we had so much reason to fear. I therefore submitted
some specimens to the best artists in Calcutta
to imitate. Their failure sufficed to dispel all anxiety
on that point. None of them come near Bewick's
engravings in accuracy.</p>

<p>Before I left Kishnagar (Nuddea) the violence of
the Indigo disturbances had been subdued, but the
Courts became choked with suits for enhancement
of rent upon the recalcitrant cultivators, and the
sore point about the genuineness of leases, &amp;c.,
became aggravated. I took courage from despair,
and in my judicial capacity (if I remember right)
addressed an official letter to the Government of
Bengal, definitely advocating administrative action
to enforce the use of 'finger-prints' by both parties
as necessary to the validity of these documents.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Unfortunately I kept no private draft of this letter,
and have lost the date, probably 1862 or 1863. It
must, however, be on record, both in Nuddea and
in the Calcutta Secretariat. Nothing came of it,
and I took no more pains about it. But a few
years ago I was pleasantly reminded by Mr. Horace
Cockerell, for some time Secretary to the Government,
who gave me the history of its reception,
viz. that it had been deemed inadvisable, when
things were quieting down, to raise a new controversy
of the sort. He added that it was a matter
of regret now, that no action whatever had been
taken, but he pointed out that legislation would
have been necessary to make the new marks
admissible in evidence, and to get such a law on
the spur of the moment would have been hopeless.
That difficulty had certainly never occurred to me
when I made the suggestion. But how weighty an
objection it was is shown by the fact that it was
long, even after the value of finger-prints had been
established in practice, before the High Court of
Calcutta, in a leading case, declared that the evidence
could not be excluded, nay more, that it was cogent.
This was many years before such a case in England.
At the time I wrote it is quite certain that no Court
in India, no pleader, no solicitor had ever recognized
such signatures as these.</p>

<p>In 1863 I took my first furlough to England,
which changed the current of my thoughts. But
I found that my own people had been more interested
than I had supposed by my correspondence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
on the subject. Among my brother Alexander's
papers was found after his death a letter telling
him my ideas, and asking him to devise a roller
of some sort, for oil-ink, better than my soft
office pads.</p>

<p>During that and later furloughs I took no public
steps about the subject. In society, of course, it
was looked on simply as a hobby, attracting no
more serious attention than did Bewick's fancy for
engraving his thumb-mark in his day. But the
warm interest shown by my own people, who had
known my early troubles in India, determined me,
during my last furlough, that before completing
my service I would give the thing an open official
trial on my own responsibility. I sailed, 1877, in
the P. and O. steamer 'Mongolia', Captain Coleman,
with my sister, now Mrs. Maclear, who was an
enthusiast on my side. We roused attention
enough on board in the Indian Ocean to obtain the
finger-prints of the Captain and many of his officers,
stewards, and kal&#257;shis; also of many of the passengers,
among whom I may especially mention
Sir Alfred and Lady Lyall (as they afterwards
became), Colonel Garrow Waterfield, and Colonel
Chermside. Some thirty years later, 1908,
Sir A. Lyall permitted me to take and use his
repeat impression. Here are facsimiles of both,
and also of Captain Coleman's, the pattern of
which was thought then to deserve enlargement.
Friendship, which for family reasons sprang up
between Colonel Garrow Waterfield and myself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
led him to take special interest in my project, and
I cannot doubt that he carried that with him to the
Punjab, where his reputation was high. Most of the
other saloon passengers were business men on their
way back to the Far East, and left us at Ceylon.
If any one of them had heard of the use of these
marks, say in China, I could not but have been told
of it. But there was not a breath of the sort. I
give here a list of the remaining signatures still in
my possession, in case any may meet with recognition:
F. Slight, Officer of the 'Mongolia', F. A.
Owen, J. Watson, R. Hawkins, F. Wingrove, O.
Westphal, J. W. Malet, G. S. Lynch, Mrs. Philip.
It is only reasonable, I think, to believe that such
a novel and evidently useful idea would have spread
by their means wherever they went. My exhibition
was frequently asked for, and I always gave a
duplicate of his mark to each person, and sometimes
added one of my own to show the extraordinary
persistence of patterns after nigh twenty years.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p><p>On my return to India, my position as Magistrate
and Collector at Hooghly, near Calcutta, gave me
the control, not only of criminal courts, but of the
jail, and of the modern Department for Registration
of Deeds of all sorts, and among minor duties the
payment of Government pensions. Registration,
of course, appealed most strongly to my desires, but
the Sub-Registrar and his clerks had to be trained,
and meanwhile the few pensioners enabled me to
break the ice myself. I was not a little anxious lest,
officially introduced, Hindus might take alarm for
their caste. The memory of the greased cartridges
of the Mutiny, so near Hooghly, was indelible. In
private experiments I had never met any such
difficulty, but the old lesson had been a severe one,
and I thought it well, when acting officially, to take
every precaution. I was careful, therefore, from the
first ostentatiously to employ Hindus to take the
impressions wanted; using, as if a matter of course,
the pad and the ink made by one of themselves
from the very seed-oil and lamp-black which were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
in constant use for the office seals in the several
departments.</p>

<p>The glad approval of the pensioners was a great
pleasure to me, and made the other registration
work astonishingly easy. The clerks took to it unhesitatingly,
and enjoyed the fun of explaining the
'Sahib's hikmat'. No one ever hesitated to do as
he was told, or to take away duplicates for talk
at home. The process of registration at that time
was regulated by a late law devised to afford the
best security then possible for the genuineness of
deeds, as far as attestation went. The signatures,
whether in full or by caste mark, or by cross, or, in
the case of women mostly, by touching the paper
with the tip of the finger wetted with ink from the
clerk's pen (see p. 35), were always made in the
presence and under the eye of the Registrar, who,
in most cases, had to rely on the sworn evidence of
witnesses attesting their personal knowledge of the
executant. The Registrar was, of course, responsible
for using his intelligence in each case to prevent
imposture. His part of the work was never impeached,
that I know, in Bengal; nevertheless,
fraudulent attempts did still come to light. Signatures
were still denied; personations in presenting
false deeds did take place, either to swindle, or, in
one case, to fabricate an alibi. As long as I was at
Hooghly I was quite satisfied that no will or other
deed registered there with the new safeguard would
ever be repudiated by the actual executant. I have
had to think otherwise since then, because many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
years afterwards a man (in another district) who had
given his finger-print before a Registrar repudiated
it. He was summoned to give his evidence on oath.
It was found that he had cut off the joints of his
fingers, hoping to defeat justice by corrupting the
witnesses so as to prove that he was <i>not</i> the man
they had recognized before the Registrar. The High
Court rejected the sworn story of an accident, and
confirmed the facts of the registration, with the
necessary consequence to the offender for his perjury.
I do not know of any other repudiation
having been pressed to this bitter end in India or
elsewhere. The contrast between the inherent weakness
of the old law and the efficiency of the new test
could not be better exemplified. This case gave
the first stern blow to the foul mischief that had
developed such cruel proportions in India under
cover of our conservative legal habits.</p>

<p>The way the new safeguard was applied at Hooghly
in 1877 was thus:&mdash;After the legal formalities of
registration had been observed, the Registrar made
the person print his two fingers on the deed, and
again in a diary book which was kept by him in the
office, for my own inspection rather than as evidence.
It is, no doubt, preserved at Hooghly still.</p>

<p>It was from this book that cuttings were made at
my request in 1892 by Mr. Duke, the magistrate,
which formed the subject of Sir Francis Galton's
volume on 'Blurred Finger-prints' (1893), to which,
for its cogency in marshalling the evidence, I must
refer my readers. I annex a tracing of one of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
enlargements, by permission of the London University,
to which he left his great collection.</p>

in 1892 for Mr. Galton.</span>
</div>

<p>Another form in which I made use of the new
system for public purposes was in the jail. The
common device of hiring a substitute to serve out
a term was not unknown, but it involved a long
risk of detection. A safer but very costly, and
therefore rare, device was sham death and a purchased
corpse, affording comparative safety after
escape. A case of this kind, carried out with the
aid of an irregularly appointed doctor, was strongly
suspected by me at Hooghly.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The precaution I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>adopted was to take the finger-prints of each offender
when passing sentence of imprisonment, both on
the records of the Court and also on the warrant to
the jailer.</p>

<p>All these processes were in full use when I left
India, on the completion of twenty-five years' service,
in 1878. I was by that time almost broken down in
health, and more so in energy. Sir Ashley Eden, the
Lieutenant-Governor, offered me a substantive Commissionership.
I had already held  such an appointment
twice, and nothing but an honest sense of
inability made me decline it now. I mention this
in explanation of the slackness on my part, but for
which the finger-print system would certainly have
been put in force in the Registration Department, at
least throughout Bengal, forty years ago. As it was,
I only tried to induce the Inspector of Jails and the
Registrar-General of the day to give the system a trial.
Fortunately I kept an office copy of this letter,
which, in reply to outside criticism, I published in
'Nature', Nov. 22, 1894, and repeat here to complete
this narrative.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<h4>(<span class="smcap">True Copy of Office Copy.</span>)</h4>

<p class="author">
<span class="smcap">Hooghly</span>, <i>August 15, 1877</i>.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear B&mdash;&mdash;</span>, &mdash;I enclose a paper which looks unusual,
but which I hope has some value. It exhibits a method of
identification of persons, which, with ordinary care in execution,
and with judicial care in the scrutiny, is, I can now
say, for all practical purposes far more infallible than photography.
It consists in taking a seal-like impression, in
common seal ink, of the markings on the skin of the two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
forefingers of the right hand (these two being taken for
convenience only).</p>

<p>I am able to say that these marks do not (bar accidents)
change in the course of ten or fifteen years so much as to
affect the utility of the test.</p>

<p>The process of taking the impression is hardly more
difficult than that of making a fair stamp of an office seal.
I have been trying it in the Jail and in the Registering
Office and among pensioners here for some months past. I
have purposely taken no particular pains in explaining the
process, beyond once showing how it is done, and once
or twice visiting the office, inspecting the signatures,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and
asking the <i>omlah</i><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> to be a little more careful. The articles
necessary are such as the <i>daftari</i><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> can prepare on a mere
verbal explanation.</p>

<p>Every person who now registers a document at Hooghly
has to sign his 'sign-manual'. None has offered the smallest
objection, and I believe that the practice, if generally
adopted, will put an end to all attempts at personation.</p>

<p>The cogency of the evidence is admitted by every one
who takes the trouble to compare a few signatures together,
and to try making a few himself. I have taken
thousands now in the course of the last twenty years, and
(bar smudges and accidents, which are rarely bad enough to
be fatal) I am prepared to answer for the identity of every
person whose 'sign-manual' I can now produce if I am
confronted with him.</p>

<p>As an instance of the value of the thing, I might suggest
that if Roger Tichborne had given his 'sign-manual' on
entering the Army on any register, the whole Orton case
would have been knocked on the head in ten minutes by
requiring Orton to make his sign-manual alongside it for
comparison.</p>

<p>I send this specimen to you because I believe that identification
is by no means the unnecessary thing in jails which one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>might presume it should be. I don't think I need dilate on
that point. Here is the means of verifying the identity of
every man in jail with the man sentenced by the court, at
any moment, day or night. Call the number up and make
him sign. If it is he, it is he; if not, he is exposed on the
spot. Is No. 1302 really dead, and is that his corpse or
a sham one? The corpse has two fingers that will answer
the question at once. Is this man brought into jail the real
Simon Pure sentenced by the magistrate? The sign-manual
on the back of the magistrate's warrant is there to testify, &amp;c.</p>

<p>For uses in other departments and transactions, especially
among illiterate people, it is available with such ease that
I quite think its general use would be a substantial contribution
towards public morality. Now that it is pretty well
known here, I do not believe the man lives who would dare
to attempt personation before the Registrar here. The
mukhtears<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> all know the potency of the evidence too well.</p>

<p>Will you kindly give the matter a little patient attention,
and then let me ask whether you would let me try it in
other jails?</p>

<p>The impressions will, I doubt not, explain themselves to
you without more words. I will say that perhaps in a small
proportion of the cases that might come to question the
study of the seals by an expert might be advisable, but that
in most cases any man of judgement giving his attention to
it cannot fail to pronounce right. I have never seen any
two signatures about which I remained in doubt after
sufficient care.</p>

<p>Kindly keep the specimens carefully.</p>

<p class="regards">Yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">W. Herschel</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>I received one answer, but its tenor was not so
encouraging as I had hoped. I was out of heart,
and did not press my request.</p>

<p>How much all this was regretted afterwards by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
others I must in simple justice record. It came
about so quietly and so honourably that it is only
now that I feel myself free to say publicly how
deeply I was touched. My first substantive Commissionership
had been given me by Sir George Campbell,
to whose house I was not long after brought
back in a dying condition from malarial fever.
Sir George and his private secretary, Mr. Luttman
Johnson, took us, my wife and myself, into the
tenderest care. Years afterwards, in 1906, the
latter befriended me in the kindliest manner at the
annual I.C.S. garden-party, which I but rarely
attended, and invited me to dine with him that
evening. It was a party of seven or eight, and the
next to arrive were Sir James and Lady Bourdillon.
His name, when our host introduced us, I only recognized
as lately Acting Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal.
To my great surprise, before our hands parted, he
told me how often he had wished to meet me, to
express his constant regret at having let my suggestion
slip through his hands when he was Registrar-General.
He remembered my letter well, and had
indeed taken action by inquiry concerning my doings
in his department, but for some reason he had lost
sight of the matter. Needless to say, we became the
firmest of friends on the spot, and I had the pleasure
of a visit from him afterwards at Oxford. It is some
years now since he and Mr. Luttman Johnson died.
None of us, as far as I know, has ever spoken of this
fine act of Sir James's except in strict privacy.</p>

<p>The Inspector of Jails of 1877, Mr. Beverley,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
afterwards a judge in the High Court of Bengal, is
still alive. Writing in 1906, he says, regretfully,
'I have no recollection of writing the letter you
refer to, but I know that, both as Registrar-General
and as Inspector of Jails, I took great interest in
the Finger-print system of identification, of which
I always regarded you as the Apostle in India'.
He too came to see me at Oxford after that, with
one of his successors in the High Court.</p>

<p>I shall say more farther on in regard to my
statement in this 1877 letter that 'these marks do
not change in the course of ten or fifteen years'.</p>

<p>During my stay at Hooghly, so near Calcutta,
I saw more society in my own house than in other
stations, and interested my friends with the novelty
of finger-printing. I give a few of their names to
which special interest attaches.</p>

<p>Among Indian gentlemen, whose prints were taken
at Hooghly in 1877, I do not know who are still
living; I can only give the names of</p>

<p>(1) B&#257;bu Dinon&#257;th P&#257;l, of Hooghly;</p>

<p>(2) B&#257;bu Lalit Mohun Singh, of Sibpur;</p>

<p>(3) B&#257;bu Upendra N&#257;r&#257;yan Nandi, of Sh&#257;h&#257;ganj.</p>

<p>Of English friends still living I am allowed to
reproduce the print of 1877, and its repeat in 1913,
of Mr. Frank Courthope, well known in Sussex and
in banking circles in London, (next page).</p>

<p>The next is remarkable. Captain V. H. Haggard,
R.N., was a child of 2&frac34; years old at Hooghly,
1877. By much ingratiation I succeeded in getting
a print of his whole hand, and another of three
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
fingers. In 1913, when on special duty in H.M.S.
'President', he kindly gave me (not for the first
time) a repeat, this time at the age of 38. The
baby print bears enlargement beautifully, and I am
sure my readers will be delighted with the comparison
I am thus able to lay before them.</p>


<p>One of the prints I value most, on personal
grounds, is that of Sir Theodore Hope, at that time
in the Legislative Council of India for Bombay. I
grieve to say he has died since these words were
written. He was one of my most honoured college
friends in the old Haileybury days of 1853.</p>

</div>

<p>Among the last prints that I took in India were
two at Mussoorie, in the Punjab Him&#257;layas, in
Sept. 1877; one of my brother Colonel J. Herschel,
R.E., and one of Dr. J. F. Duthie, of the
Forest Department. They are both living still, and
their repeats to-day are quite good.</p>

<p>To return now to my letter of 1877. I was
'able to say that these marks do not change in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the course of ten or fifteen years'. I might have
said eighteen years, for my own marks reached back
to 1859; but I was steering for safety.</p>

<p>The conviction of the unchanging character of
finger-patterns had, of course, grown on me only
by degrees, as the evidence of time accumulated.
Among my friends, from Nuddea days onwards,
I often took second impressions, invariably drawing
attention to their identity with the former ones. I
never came upon any sign of change, bar accident.
But such comparisons were generally limited to
intervals of no more than two or three years, owing
to the frequent changes of residence incidental to
Indian service. As time went on it was chiefly the
incessant evidence of my own ten fingers, and of my
whole hand, which wrought in me the overwhelming
conviction that the lines on the skin persisted
indefinitely.</p>

</div>

<p>But besides my own evidence of eighteen years, I
had that of my oldest college friend, William Waterfield,
of almost as long. On March 31, 1877, he and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Mr. (afterwards Sir Theodore) Hope and Mrs. Hope
were my guests at Hooghly. I took all their impressions
and my own on that day, noting on Waterfield's
that we compared it with his earliest print of
1860, in Nuddea, seventeen years earlier. We found
the agreement, of course, complete. Here are the
facsimiles.</p>

<p>If more evidence were required, I was prepared,
without hesitation, to call on any person whose mark
I had taken since I began. It was in fact from
among those very persons, Natives as well as English,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
that thirteen years later, at Mr. Galton's request,
I obtained the repeats which, by their much longer
persistence then, went so far to prove his case to
universal conviction.</p>

<p>I close this record with a comparison between
three of my own prints, taken, one in 1859, one in
1877, and the last to-day, after fifty-seven years.
For length of persistence they cannot at present be
matched.</p>

<p>It goes beyond the proper scope of this narrative,
but I cannot refrain from offering my readers here
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
a striking instance of the almost incredible persistency
of atomic renovation that takes place in the
pads of our fingers, in spite of their being more
subject to wear than any other part of the body.
The first was taken at the age of 7&frac34;; the next, for
Mr. Galton, nine years later. In 1913 my son was
in Canada when I asked him to send me several
repeats. Every print showed the minute tell-tale
dot which Mr. Galton's sharp eye had noticed twenty-two
years before. No doubt it was a natal mark.
It has anyhow already persisted for thirty-two
years.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX</h2>


<p>When I speak of the 'discovery' of finger-prints
nigh sixty years ago, I should wish to be understood
correctly. I cannot say that I thought of it as such
until Mr. Galton examined old records in search of
earlier notices of the subject. What he found had
been beyond my ken, and I never inquired for
myself. The fascination of experiments and the
impelling object of them were all I cared about.
Had it been otherwise I should have had an open
field for egoism to any extent, for no one questioned
the novelty of the thing.</p>

<p>The time that has elapsed since Galton's inquiries,
without any material addition to his ascertained
facts, justifies me, I venture to think, in speaking
of my work as the 'discovery' of the value of finger-prints.</p>

<p>I proceed to show what has been brought to light
from other sources.</p>


<h3>Bewick.</h3>

<p>Of modern cases the first known is that of
Thomas Bewick. He was a wood-engraver, as well
as an author, and had a fancy for engraving his
finger-mark. He printed, as far as I can ascertain,
only three specimens, by way of ornament to his
books.</p>

<p>1. 1809. 'British Birds', p. 190. The impression
of the finger appears as if obliterating a small scene
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
of a cottage, trees, and a rider, but the paper
between the lines of the finger is almost all
clean.</p>

<p>2. 1818. The 'Receipt'; of which, by Mr.
Quaritch's favour, I possess one. This is, beyond
all possibility of doubt, quite free from any tooling.
How it was transferred to paper in those days (of
which there is an indication) I am unable to say,
but for his purposes it was an original 'finger-print'
of Thomas Bewick. Even the fine half-tone
process of this facsimile cannot reproduce its
delicacy.</p>

</div>

<p>3. 1826. Memorial Edition of Bewick's Works,
1885, on the last page of the last volume, under
a letter dated 1826, in which he rates some one for
copying his woodcuts. When I saw it at the British
Museum some years ago I thought it showed toolwork.</p>

<p>These three seem to be all the specimens now
available, and they are from three different fingers,
of which two are certified to be his own.</p>

<p>Gathering that Mr. Quaritch was exceptionally
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
familiar with Bewick's life, I told him that I wished
to leave no stone unturned to do ample justice to
him, if he was known to have done anything more
than appears above. Mr. Quaritch took the matter
up very kindly, and finally informed me that he
had been unable to trace any writing of Bewick's
concerning these prints. There seems, therefore,
no evidence that he ever took impressions of any
finger but his own. Now it is true that no one of
observant habits, and least of all an engraver, could
fail to perceive the peculiarities of his own finger.
The brick-makers of Babylon and Egypt, and every
printer since fingers were dirtied by printer's ink,
must have noticed them. But it is a long step from
that to a study of other men's marks, with a view to
identification. What Bewick certainly did do might
easily have led him to such a study, but it looks as
if he was satisfied with recognizing his own mark.</p>

<p>Remembering, as I have already said, how one of
his marks had struck my fancy as a boy, I am disposed
to believe that, all unwittingly, I was guided
to seize upon a thread which Bewick had let fall.</p>


<h3>Purkinje.</h3>

<p>Five years after Bewick, Johannes Purkinje, of
Breslau, in 1823, read an essay which has been found
and examined by Mr. Galton, and partly translated
on p. 85 of his 1892 work. Purkinje carried
his study of the patterns on fingers beyond all comparison
with Bewick's use of them, of whose existence
indeed he could hardly have been aware. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
worked hard on them for a scientific (medical) purpose.
It seemed to me strange that, going so far as
he did, he had not hit upon our idea. To satisfy
myself I read his work through in 1909. The very
last sentence in it seemed to strike a light. Referring
to 'the varieties of the tonsils, and especially of the
papillae of the tongue, in different individuals' (no
mention of fingers), he finishes the sentence and his
essay by saying: 'from all which [varieties] sound
materials will be furnished for that individual knowledge
of the man which is of no less importance than
a general knowledge of him is, especially in the
practice of medicine.' A fine conclusion indeed,
and a stimulating; but no part of his essay conveys
an inkling of identification by means of any of the
individual varieties on which he always lays stress,
not even his pioneer work in the classification of
the markings on fingers.</p>

<h3>Bengal.</h3>

<p>The common way for illiterates to
sign is to wet the tip of one finger with ink from
a pen, and then touch the document (leaving a small
black blot) where we touch a wafer.  The mark
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
so made is called '<i>tep-sai</i>', 'tep' meaning 'pressure'
by touch or grip, and 'sai' meaning 'token' (I do
not know the etymology). I ask my readers now
to compare the '<i>tep-sai</i>' with the 'finger-print'
alongside it, and to say whether the <i>tep-sai</i> could
afford any means of identification by comparison
with another blot from the same finger. Illiterates
who can hold a pen make a cross, as we do, called
'<i>dhera-sai</i>'; others, more ambitious, indicate their
caste by symbols. For the interest of the thing
I give some tracings from a collection of such caste-marks
which I had made for this purpose when
I was Magistrate of Midnapore in 1865.</p>

<p>When I was introducing actual registration I

as follows (the English is of course his own):</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="author">Hooghly, &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
The 21st Aug./77.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I have examined the impressions made in these
papers, and I think each can be distinguished from
the others. There are also so many peculiarities in
each impression that it cannot be forged, and I think
it would be a preventive to forgery if all documents,
specially by females, or males who do not know to
read or write, would contain impressions by fingers.</p>

<p class="regards">Yours faithfully,</p>
<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Eshan Chundra Mitra</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>I value this letter highly, for Eshan Chundra was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Government Pleader at Hooghly, and in frequent
request in Calcutta. No native lawyer of his large
practice could have written thus if he had ever
known of this method of signature before.</p>

<p>Trustworthy information in my hands is to the
effect that attestations by the finger in China are
like Bengali <i>tep-sais</i>, and nothing more.</p>


<h3>China.</h3>

<p>The nearest approach to our use of finger-prints
that I have found in China came to hand thus:</p>

<p>An Oxford friend, Mr. Bullock, subsequently
elected Professor of Chinese, had been interpreter
to the Legation in Peking. Talking with him about
the methods of signing deeds in China, he told me
that the finger-tip (not finger-print) method was in
ordinary use, but he was careful to point out also
that to his knowledge ever since he went to Peking,
about 1868, Chinese bankers had been in the habit
of impressing their thumbs on the notes they issued;
and he had no doubt the custom was much older
than that. This was startling, but he kindly procured
for me the bank-note which I here show in
facsimile; with it came this explanation of such
thumb-marks, given by his friend in China:</p>

<p>'They are imprinted partly on the counterfoil and
partly on the note itself, so that when presented its
genuineness can be tested at once.'</p>

<p>That is, they play the part of what is technically
called the 'scroll' in our cheques.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 271px;">
<img src="images/i042.jpg" width="271" height="640" alt="A CHINESE BANK NOTE" title="" />
<span class="caption">A CHINESE BANK NOTE, 1898</span>
</div>


<p>My readers may accept it that the ink used was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the same Indian ink with which the Chinese characters
on the note were written. That is the unhesitating
judgement of such an expert as Mr. Galton,
who examined it. The difference between a water
ink and printer's ink for identification is enormous.
Blood on the fingers has occasionally left impressions
that fortunately sufficed to reveal the murderer; but,
as a rule, wet fingers leave only smudges as useless
as this one. It is quite certain, therefore, that no
one in the habit of impressing his thumb-mark as
this banker did, would use water ink, if he depended
on recognizing it as his own. In short, the smudge
on the bank-note was placed there in order to
identify the two parts of a piece of paper after
severance, not to prove who placed it so. My
readers may see what exquisite delicacy of detail
can be obtained by printer's ink, when so desired,
if they will examine a fine skin impression with
a magnifying-glass; even the pores along the ridges
can be seen as white dots. For practical purposes,
however, such extreme delicacy as this is
not needed.</p>

<p>This difference of ink suggests a further remark.
The Chinese have used printer's ink for ages. If
they aimed at identification they would surely have
discovered its great value for clear impressions, and
its use could never have died out. On the other
hand, a method of identification depending on water
ink could never have survived for such strict work
as our finger-prints. On the palm of the hand
it can give a fairly good impression for such simple
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
identification as is wanted (say) for passports, because
the large creases will obviously be those of the
bearer of the passport, or as obviously not. These
lines of the palm, so well known in palmistry, are
as clear to a man as the shape of his hand, while
those on the pads of his own fingers are scarcely
noticed even now by one man in a million. The
science of identification by means of the pads
cannot, in my opinion, date farther back than 1858,
when I happened to use oil-ink, which was not used
for <i>tep-sais</i>.</p>

<p>The ablest defence of the claims of antiquity
that I have seen is by a Japanese writer, Kumagusu
Minakata, whose letter to 'Nature', Dec. 27, 1894,
appears to be as exhaustive as it is able; but
I hope that this paper will satisfy him that the
finger-print system of our day has no connexion with
the methods he describes. The 'nail-marks' of which
he speaks must be utterly useless for identification;
yet he treats all manner of impressions alike, and
tells us indeed that they are all known by the one
name of 'hand-mark'. I fear that he has failed,
like some other writers,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> to see the definite force of
the word 'identification' in the finger-print system.
It means that if a man can be indicated whose finger-print
agrees with that on a document, he is identified
with the man who put that one there. That is all
we want. But it will be seen that there must be two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
impressions at least, that will bear comparison, to
constitute 'identification'.</p>

<p>None of the writers who have undertaken the
defence appears to perceive this need of a second
impression if the issue of identity turns on any kind
of finger-mark. Repudiations cannot have been
rare; tribunals must occasionally have been invoked;
yet no instance is quoted of decision by
demand for a second impression.</p>

<p>It seems then that these marks were not made,
as ours are, expressly to challenge comparison; that,
in fact, they offer no points for comparison.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it is hard to believe that a system
so practically useful as this could have been known
in the great lands of the East for generations past,
without arresting the notice of Western statesmen,
merchants, travellers, and students. Yet the knowledge
never reached us.</p>

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
